I decided to learn ELM language mostly for fun.

I found it a very comfortable language.
Setup worked at first try, the language basics are extremely easy to learn: everything is a function, immutable, without side effects.

The hard parts were the ELM Architecture, the messaging system and the Random Generators.

Once get those ideas and made the mental shift needed, it was a breeze.

Here you can find the Minesweeper code (a single 450 line file) and here you can try it out.
